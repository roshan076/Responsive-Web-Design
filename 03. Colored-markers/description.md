# Colored Markers

This project creates a simple visual representation of colored markers using HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The webpage displays three markers, each in a different color (red, green, and blue), with a title centered at the top. Each marker consists of two main parts:

- **Cap**: The top portion of the marker.
- **Sleeve**: The body of the marker, represented as a rectangular shape.

The markers are styled using gradients and box shadows, giving them a 3D-like appearance. The colors used for the markers correspond to red, green, and blue.

## HTML Structure

- The main container (`<div class="container">`) holds three marker elements.
- Each marker (`<div class="marker">`) has two child elements:
  - `<div class="cap">` represents the cap of the marker.
  - `<div class="sleeve">` represents the sleeve of the marker.

The three markers are styled differently using CSS classes: `red`, `green`, and `blue`.

## CSS Styling

The markers are styled with a combination of positioning, gradients, and shadows to achieve a visually appealing and realistic look. 

- **Gradients**: Each marker has a unique gradient applied to the `background` property to give it a vibrant color.
- **Box Shadows**: A subtle shadow effect is applied to each marker using `box-shadow` to make it stand out.
- **Layout**: The marker parts (cap and sleeve) are styled to align horizontally, mimicking the look of an actual marker.

### Key Features:

- **Responsive Layout**: The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes by centering the main container.
- **Gradient Effects**: The gradients used for each marker create a smooth transition between colors.
- **Shadows**: Box shadows add a 3D effect, making the markers appear elevated.
