# CatPhotoApp

This is the HTML file for the **CatPhotoApp** project, created as part of the Responsive Web Design curriculum. The project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML to structure a webpage that displays cat photos, cat-related lists, and an interactive form.

## Overview

The **CatPhotoApp** page is structured into several key sections:

- **Header & Main Content**: The document begins with a proper DOCTYPE declaration and sets the language to English. The `<head>` includes essential metadata and the title "CatPhotoApp".
  
- **Cat Photos Section**:  
  - Displays a welcoming heading and a brief paragraph with a link to a cute cat image.
  - Provides an image wrapped in a hyperlink, encouraging users to explore more cat photos.

- **Cat Lists Section**:  
  - Contains an unordered list showcasing things cats love.
  - Includes a figure with an image and caption illustrating that cats love lasagna.
  - Provides an ordered list detailing the top 3 things cats hate, along with a corresponding image and caption.

- **Cat Form Section**:  
  - Features a form asking users whether their cat is indoor or outdoor, using radio buttons.
  - Includes checkboxes for the cat's personality traits.
  - Contains a text input for submitting a cat photo URL and a submit button.

- **Footer**:  
  - The page ends with a footer crediting freeCodeCamp and ensuring that the content is free to use.

## Key HTML Elements Used

- **Semantic Structure**:  
  - `<main>`, `<section>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>` help organize the content meaningfully.
  
- **Media & Links**:  
  - `<img>` tags display images with descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility.
  - `<a>` tags create hyperlinks that open in new tabs for external content.

- **Lists**:  
  - `<ul>` for unordered lists and `<ol>` for ordered lists present content in a clear, structured format.

- **Forms**:  
  - `<form>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` work together to create an interactive form, complete with radio buttons and checkboxes.
