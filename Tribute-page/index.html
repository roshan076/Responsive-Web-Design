                <li><b>1833</b> - Meets Charles Babbage, who inspires her interest in Mathematics</li>
                <li><b>1842</b> - Writes extensive notes on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which includes the first algorithm intented to be processed by a machine, effectively making her the world's first computer programmer</li>
                <li><b>1843</b> - Publishes her translation of Luigi Menabrea's work on the Analytical Engine, adding her own comprehensive notes, which includes the algorithm and her vision of the machine's potential</li>
                <li><b>1852</b> - Passes away at the age of 36 from uterine cancer, leaving behind a legacy as a pioneering mathematician and visionary in the field of computing.</li>

                <p>"Ada's life reminds us that the power of imagination is just as crucial as the power of logic in the realm of science and technology"</p>
